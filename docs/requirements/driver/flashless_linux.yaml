      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_15
        description: If aq_fw_sid option is passed as an array and the length of array is more than number of devices present in the system, driver should skip redundant parameters.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_16
        description: If aq_fw_sid option is passed as single integer, the driver should use it only for the first device in the system.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_17
        description: If aq_fw_sid option is passed as single integer but number of devices if more than 1, the driver should act the same way when aq_fw_sid is an array.

      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_18
        description: The driver can be loaded with option force_host_boot which forces flashless load even the flash with correct firmware is present.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_19
        description: force_host_boot module option can have value 0 or not 0 (i. e. >= 0), it's also can be array of such values.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_20
        description: If the driver is loaded with force_host_boot module option as an array; example force_host_boot=1,0; the driver should take specified action for appropriate device in the system.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_21
        description: If force_host_boot option is passed as an array and the length of array is less than number of devices present in the system, driver should use force_host_boot=0 for the rest of devices.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_22
        description: If force_host_boot option is passed as an array and the length of array is more than number of devices present in the system, driver should skip redundant parameters.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_23

      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_24
        description: If force_host_boot option is passed as single integer but number of devices if more than 1, the driver should act the same way when force_host_boot is an array.

        description: default_sid kernel module option can only be 4-byte integer, example default_sid=87b11d6a, it's value cannot be more than 0xffffffff, if it's value more than 0xffffffff the driver should trace error message and fail.

      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_27
        description: The driver should load firmware file using device id, that should be read from PCI config space.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_28
        description: If DID is present in PCI config space and aq_fw_did kernel option is also provided, the driver should use aq_fw_did parameter.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_29
        description: If DID in PCI config space or aq_fw_did are equal to 0x0001, that mean default DID and the driver should detect flashless firmware using Chip ID (see table in paragraph 1.4 in the documentation).
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_30
        description: Flashless should never start on Apple IDs - DID 0x87b1 + SVID 0x106b or DID 0x91b1 + SVID 0x106b

      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_31
        description: After loading firmware file the driver should use SVID and SSID parameters to select MAC/PHY BDPs, SVID and SSID can be read from PCI config space.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_32
        description: If SVID/SSID are present in PCI config space and aq_fw_sid option is passed by the user the driver should use aq_fw_sid parameter.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_33
        description: If SVID/SSID are present in PCI config space, aq_fw_sid and default_sid options are passed by the user the driver should use aq_fw_sid parameter.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_34
        description: If SVID/SSID are present in PCI config space, aq_fw_sid is not passed and default_sid option is passed by the user the driver should use SVID/SSID from PCI config space.
      - id: DRV_LINUX_FLASHLESS_35
        description: If for some reason SVID/SSID are not present in PCI config space (or have unknown value), aq_fw_sid is not passed and default_sid option is not passed by the user the driver should use 1d6a0001 for SVID/SSID.
        note: Impossible to implement such scenario.
